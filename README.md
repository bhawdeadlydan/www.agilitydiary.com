====================

Prerequisites:

* Node


Terminal Tab 1:

Running the local server using regular Node (does not update)

	cd web-node-angular
	node app.js

This will run the Node webserver.


Terminal Tab 2: (optional)

Now you need grunt to run the build process so do

	cd public

	grunt serve

This should now be automatically building your SCSS and JavaScripts and everything.

** YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO USE THIS COS THE SASS BUILD PART IS QUITE SLOW **

THIS IS THE DEPLOY BRANCH
